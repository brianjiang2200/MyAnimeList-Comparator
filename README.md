Hi! Thanks for checking out this small webapp. It uses the Jikan.moe API to find common anime and manga among multiple users as well as their scores from the MyAnimelist site.  
The webapp requires react scripts to run, a simple shortcut (you must have npm) is to run npx create-react-app, and install react-router-dom with the command npm install react-router-dom. Then you can clone this repository into the same folder.
